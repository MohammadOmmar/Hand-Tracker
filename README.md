# Hand-Tracker
This project is a lightweight hand-tracking demo built with HTML, JavaScript, and a browser-based machine learning library. It uses the webcam to detect and track hand landmarks in real time, allowing you to visualize hand positions directly on the screen. The code is simple and beginner-friendly.
